  Kasi Insights provides guidance to Bankers, Small Lenders and Individuals for common lending practices within the following African countries - South Africa, Kenya, Ivory Coast, .....
  Lending Environment Simulation Tool will be used by the bankers who are interested to have a proxy in the area to run small money lending shop in the bank's behalf.

# Introduction

Kasi Insights uses surveys to find economic indices. One of the surveys is for Lenders.
Lenders lend to individuals. Individuals belong to a Hub within a known radius of the Hub.
Individuals are grouped as communities belonging to each hub. there are multiple communities across a country.
Currently Kasi Insights deals with seven African countries.
The questions specific to lending habbits are gathered in survey questions.
If lenders are borrowers of a bank or financial institution - we can determine the risk profile of the lenders for the Banks/Financial institutions.
Countries in Africa (South Africa, Ivory Coast, Kenya...).
These countries have custom lending process and dont have means to track the transaction history.
The data is gathered utilizing community crowd sourced survey data by Kasi Insights.



# Problem Statement

Kasi Insights needs Lending Environment Simulation Tool and Lender Evaluation Tool.
Lending Evaluation Simulation tool: TODO
Lender Evaluation Tool: TODO


# Background

Kasi Insights currently gathers the Lender Survey Results and utilizes Excel Sheet to perform calculations and get the Credit Scores for the Lenders. The need is to develop a tool which will help to evaluate the lenders and categorize them in appropriate pre-defined catogories.

 
 
 
# Dataset Description
The dataset was rearranged and consolidated into from separate survey results by Kasi Insights.
This way all the columns/features were standardized for all the data that was being handled.
2 csv files were provided for analysis.
Both files were merged programatically and analyzed to better understand the same.
The combined dataset from 2 csv's has:
Records 29383
Features 38
Additional work needs to be done on above after consulting with Kasi Insights.

The column dictionary is as follows:
0: "Timestamp",
1: "Location ID",
2: "Has it become more difficult or easier to find a job in your city?",
3: "Is this a good time for people to make a large purchase such as furnitu
4: "Compared to the last 6 months, are you able to spend (more, the same or
5: "Will you be able to meet your regular expenses over the next 6 months?"
6: "How do you expect your householdâ€™s income to change over the next 6 mont
7: "How do you expect general economic conditions in your city to change ove
8: "How do you expect general economic conditions in your country to change
9: "Gender",
10:"Marital status",
11:"Age",
12:"What's your highest level of education?",
13:"Occupation",
14:"If you are a student, what level are you currently studying?",
15:"Race/Ethnicity",
16:"Country",
17:"What is the name of the neighborhood where you live?",
18:"Over the past 3 months, how many times have you lent someone money?",
19:"On average how much do you lend in general?",
20:"Who did you lend money to in the past 3 months?",
21:"When you lend money, when do you usually expect to get it repaid?",
22:"Do you include either interest or a lending fee when you lend?",
23:"Do you request guarantees when you lend?",
24:"Do you receive your money back in time?",
25:"Assuming that you have lent money at least ten times, how often would yo
26:"What's the most common use of the money you lend?",
27:"Have you ever applied for a bank loan?",
28:"Are you a tontine / lending club member?",
29:"What is the most convenient way to get a loan?",
30:"To what extent do you agree with the following sentences Access to cred
31:"To what extent do you agree with the following sentences Credit is bene
32:"To what extent do you agree with the following sentences I would like t
33:"What type of loans are you currently paying of?",
34:"Do you have a credit score?",
35:"Do you have a credit card?",
36:"On average, how much of your total household monthly income do you spend
37:"If you wanted to take a loan to start a business, how much would you nee

The above columns are trimmed at the end of the string - for display purposes.

The following will be delivered in the order mentioned:
1. Model for Lending Evaluation Simulation
2. Model for Lender Evaluation
3. Web based (Python, Flask, Angular) UI which will demonstrate the usage of the models created

Each model will be a microservice and make it communicate via a REST Service API interface.
The web application front end UI - developed in Angular - will provide input fields for the end user to enter (will include basic data entry validation).
The UI will invoke the right microservice and get a json response back to be displayed to the end user.
