  Kasi Insights provides guidance to Bankers, Small Lenders and Individuals for common lending practices within the following African countries - South Africa, Kenya, Ivory Coast, .....
  Lending Environment Simulation Tool will be used by the bankers who are interested to have a proxy in the area to run small money lending shop in the bank's behalf.

# Introduction

Kasi Insights uses surveys to find economic indices. One of the surveys is for Lenders.
Lenders lend to individuals. Individuals belong to a Hub within a known radius of the Hub.
Individuals are grouped as communities belonging to each hub. there are multiple communities across a country.
Currently Kasi Insights deals with seven African countries.
The questions specific to lending habbits are gathered in survey questions.
If lenders are borrowers of a bank or financial institution - we can determine the risk profile of the lenders for the Banks/Financial institutions.
Countries in Africa (South Africa, Ivory Coast, Kenya...).
These countries have custom lending process and dont have means to track the transaction history.
The data is gathered utilizing community crowd sourced survey data by Kasi Insights.



# Problem Statement

Kasi Insights needs Lending Environment Simulation Tool and Lender Evaluation Tool.
Lending Evaluation Simulation tool: TODO
Lender Evaluation Tool: TODO


# Background

Kasi Insights currently gathers the Lender Survey Results and utilizes Excel Sheet to perform calculations and get the Credit Scores for the Lenders. The need is to develop a tool which will help to evaluate the lenders and categorize them in appropriate pre-defined catogories.

 
# Dataset Description
The dataset is available for past 3 years (to be confirmed) consisting of survey results for the Lenders.
There survery results are available both in English and French.
Kasi Insights will provide the excel sheets properly sorted based on language.
The columns will be standardized across the different spread sheets so that parsing and data validation can be standardized.
The re-arranged spread sheets will be provided by Kasi Insights.
There are 10 Lender specific survey questions - which will be utilized for producing the 2 ML models.


# ML Solution

TODO
```{r example, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Approach"}

```# ML Solution

# Project Plan

TODO



The following will be delivered in the order mentioned:
1. Model for Lending Evaluation Simulation
2. Model for Lender Evaluation
3. Web based (Python, Flask, Angular) UI which will demonstrate the usage of the models created

Each model will be a microservice and make it communicate via a REST Service API interface.
The web application front end UI - developed in Angular - will provide input fields for the end user to enter (will include basic data entry validation).
The UI will invoke the right microservice and get a json response back to be displayed to the end user.
Platforms like AWS and GCP are available to productionalize the web application and the microservices.
AWS will be the first choice for the deployment and as an alternate GCP will be utilized for demonstration of the UI part, interacting with microservice.
